It is a tile-based, turn based strategy game where 2 players control their COs armies to devastate the opponent's forces. The game is won after a player has sucessfully routed the enemy player's forces, or once they have captured their H.Q.<br><br>During the player's turn they may move their armies, attack enemy units, build new units, and activate their CO's powers to gain an advantage over their opponent.
